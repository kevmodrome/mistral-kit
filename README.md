# MISTRAL-KIT

Get HTML + Tailwind with a simple web interface!

## Caveats

It's obviously not perfect. Sometimes the responses are not ideal and the preview breaks. The code it responds with usually ends up being pretty good.

## Run it!

0. Install `pnpm i`
1. Install ollama and pick your model. I used mistral-7b.
2. Run project `pnpm run dev`
3. Prompt!
4. Profit!
